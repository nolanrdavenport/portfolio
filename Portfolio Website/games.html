                        Beleaguerment is a three-dimensional top down shooter game built<br> 
                        in Unity 3D that was inspired by Rainbow Six: Siege. I stressed <br>
                        many skills such as programming, 3D modelling, and google-fooing.
                        <br> The game was scripted in C# and modelled in Blender.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        This is not only a simple tiny tanks game, but one that supports<br> 
                        networking! I developed both a server program that hosts the connection<br> 
                        between the players and a client program that allows the user to control <br>
                        their vehicle. This has only been tested between different computers in<br> 
                        a private network, but I am sure with some port forwarding, you can actually<br>
                        connect people in different households.

                    <p>
                        This is a cool little piece of software that shows how you can produce<br> 
                        complex systems and behavioural patterns from very simple rules.<br> 
                        This game has three rules: <br><br> 
                        1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.<br>
                        2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.<br> 
                        3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly,<br> 
                        all other dead cells stay dead.<br>
