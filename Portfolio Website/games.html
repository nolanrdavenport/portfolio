                        Beleaguerment is a three-dimensional top down shooter game built<br> in Unity 3D that was inspired by Rainbow Six: Siege. I stressed <br>many skills such as programming, 3D modelling, and google-fooing.
                        <br> The game was scripted in C# and modelled in Blender.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        This is not only a simple tiny tanks game, but one that supports networking!<br> I developed both a server program that hosts the connection between the players<br> and a client program that allows the user to control their vehicle.
                        This has only <br> been tested between different computers in a private network, but I am sure with some<br> port forwarding, you can actually connect people in different households.<br>
