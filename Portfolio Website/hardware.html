                        This is the hardware design for the smart lock. Unfortunately, I have not yet designed a PCB for the smart lock, though I am working on it. You can find the schematic for this project

                        This is my design for a multicycle processor. It has a word width of 24 bits, and an instruction size of 27 bits. This processor uses harvard architecture with a separate instruction and data memory. It currently supports add, addi, lw, sw, li, and bleq
                        operations. These operations were tested in a verilog test bench and supported two programs:<br><br>

                    <h1>Pong on a custom LED array</h1>
                    <p>
                        This is the game of pong programmed to run on a custom made LED array with the dimensions of 11x9 'pixels'. The LEDs were each connected to a current limiting resistor and fed into 25 logic AND IC's. The logic gates were used to allow the control of 99
                        LEDs with only 20 pins on the microcontroller. <br><br> Alongside the hardware principles that I used to build this, I also used my experience with game development in this project by developing pong. Also,
                        I had to solve some problems with displaying the sprites using methods that I know were used in old consoles, such as the original NES where only some sprites were rendered onto the screen for each frame due to hardware limitations.

                    <p>
                        This is a miniature 8-bit ALU. There is a clock input, aswell as 8 data bits. If a correct operation code is input, then it will input the two 8 bit numbers and store them into registers. After that, depending on the op code, the circuit will either add,
                        subtract, or compare the two numbers. Then, the result will be located on the output pins. This isn't a combinational ALU, but it instead takes multiple cycles to complete each operation.
