                    <h1>Pong on a custom LED array</h1>
                    <p>
                        This is the game of pong programmed to run on a custom made LED array with<br>
                        the dimensions of 11x9 'pixels'. The LEDs were each connected to a current <br>
                        limiting resistor and fed into 25 logic AND IC's. The logic gates were used<br>
                        to allow the control of 99 LEDs with only 20 pins on the microcontroller. <br><br>
                        Alongside the hardware principles that I used to build this, I also used my<br>
                        experience with game development in this project by developing pong. Also,<br>
                        I had to solve some problems with displaying the sprites using methods that<br>
                        I know were used in old consoles, such as the original NES where only some<br>
                        sprites were rendered onto the screen for each frame due to hardware limitations.
