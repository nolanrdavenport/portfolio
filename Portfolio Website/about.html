        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I have been intrigued by computer technology for as long as I can remember. The possibilities of what can be done with computers are endless, from massive productivity boosts, to next level entertainment. Because of how amazing this technology is, I have
            decided that my goal in life is to become a jack of all trades in computing, from software development, to computer hardware. In order to help me achieve this goal, I am looking for internships in either the hardware or software field of computer
            technology, and I believe my experiences and skills, such as four years of programming experience and a healthy understanding and willingness to learn about computer architecture, will make me a valuable candidate for a role in either field.
