        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring embedded software engineer who loves programming and learning about computer architecture. I started programming simple games over 5 years ago, and I now spend my time learning lower level software development with C/C++. University is
            where I started learning about the hardware aspect of computers and it's making me understand and appreciate what is actually going on lower in the layers of abstraction. Because of my unending interest in computers, I am looking for an internship
            in either embedded software, hardware engineer, or other forms of software development. <br><br>To help pay for my education, I work as a freelance electronics engineer with skills in IoT design and PCB design. If you are interested
            in that, my contact information is below!
