        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Dallas and I am graduating with my Bachelor's in Fall 2022. I am in pursuit of a career in Embedded Software Engineering because I am very interested in writing low level software very
            close to the hardware. Alongside that, I am intrigued by the fact that you can program a $1 integrated circuit to control electrical devices and systems. I am excited to spend my career learning about all of the wonderful ways you can use
            tiny embedded computers to make life easier.
            <br><br> In terms of my experience with embedded systems, I have one year of freelance embedded electronics experience, supporting ESP32 based IoT products. Alongside that, I have personal embedded systems projects, including an ESP32 based
            smart lock. I am also the electrical/microcontroller lead for the UTD Robosub club where we are in the middle of designing an ROV controlled by an STM32 MCU.
            <br><br> I hope you can consider me a good fit for any entry level embedded systems positions.
