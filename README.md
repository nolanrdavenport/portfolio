## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my programming projects. Unfortunately, only a few of my projects are showcased because I was too young and immature during highschool to save my projects on a cloud and most of them were lost one way or another. 

## Experience
Java (3 Years)

C# (Unity Scripting)

C++ (< 2 months)
